# Overhead Tile Fade for All Tokens
When a token goes under an overhead tile with fade, the default is to only have it fade for that token. This module provides options to have the tile fade for other tokens as well. The options are the Foundry default, by visibility, by disposition, and for every token. Below is break down of the options:

## By visibility
If another token that your token can see is under an overhead tile, the tile will fade to reveal the token.

## Foundry Default (Off)
Provides the Foundry Default functionality where an overhead tile is only faded for the token that is under the tile.
