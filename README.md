# Overhead Tile Fade for All Tokens
When a token goes under an overhead tile with fade, the default is to only have it fade for that token. This module provides options to have the tile fade for other tokens as well. The options are the Foundry default, by visibility, by disposition, and for every token. Below is break down of the options:

## By visibility
If another token that your token can see is under an overhead tile, the tile will fade to reveal the token.

## By Disposition
If a token that matches the set dispositions goes under an overhead tile, the tile will fade to reveal the token. This can be limited so that only friendly, neutral, and/or hostile tokens fade the tile. This is if you want your baddies to not have their position given away just because they are under a tile. There is also the option to prevent hidden tokens from fading the tile. This setting is from the original version of the module and is far inferior to the by visibility option, but decided to leave in, just in case.

## All Tokens
If any token goes under an overhead tile, the tile will fade for everyone.
