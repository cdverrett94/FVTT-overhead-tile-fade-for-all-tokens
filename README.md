# Overhead Tile Fade for All Tokens
When a token goes under an overhead tile with fade, the default is to only have it fade for that token. This hides the token for all other tokens and players. This module overrides the default behavior to have the fade show for all tokens instead so the token remains visible to all players. This only applies to tiles with the fade occlusion setting. 

There are settings that allow greater control over the fade for all tokens on a per tile basis. You can have the token only fade if there's friendly/neutral/hostile token underneath. You can also prevent the fade for all tokens if there's a hidden token under the tile.
